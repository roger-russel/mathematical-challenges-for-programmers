# 03 - Groups Combination 02

This challenge is about group combination, a little more simple than [01-groups-combination](https://github.com/mateusmaaia/mathematical-challenges-for-programmers/tree/master/challenges/01-groups-combination)

## Challenge

You need to group all strings has the same composition. Eg. "123" and "213"

You also need to do it the more performatic way, avoid answers bigger or equal O(N^2)

## Example

Input: 
`
["123","424","2424", "244", "321"]
`

Output:
`[
["123", "321"],
["424", "244"],
["2424"]
]`

## Need some tips?

You can look at [here](tips/) for some tips if you are lost, but would be bether if you figure by yourself how to do it.

The first tip is about how to do it mathematicaly, so if you just wanna try to programm it, don't be shy and give it a look.
